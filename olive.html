          <p>Olive app is designed for the health-conscious individual who wants to tend to their health and wellbeing needs by having the functions to input, track, analyze, and share health and wellness information for the purpose of clearing their mind and being able to present themselves more available to the people in their lives and the schedules and tasks they need to tend to on a regular basis. ​​​​​​​
More than ever today, we live in a digital world where everything is connected and virtual. We’re always on our screens and this can cause people to experience stress to different degrees and even feel burnt out. Work, relationships, and life in general can be a stress in itself, so it’s unquestionable that people struggle to manage a healthier lifestyle, especially if they have existing health needs and conditions. There are many resources and tools out there to help manage and help people’s health and wellbeing, and Olive App is one of them.</p>

          <p>The everyday health-conscious individual needs a responsive health and wellbeing app to record their health and medical information and access general physical and mental wellbeing features because it will help improve their overall wellbeing and tracking of information.</p>

    <h2>My Approach and Research Highlights</h2>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <ul><li>Interviews</li>
      <li>Mental Models</li>
      <li>User Journeys</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research Goals</h2>
    <p>I conducted 3 user interviews in person and recorded the sessions with permission. Afterwards, I organized the information provided by the participants using the affinity mapping process. Quotes from the participants, and observations about what they shared were divided into following categories: Behaviors &amp; Attitudes, Needs &amp; Goals, Frustrations, Quotes, and Facts.</p>

    Some key insights and opportunities from the data collected include:
    <ul><li>Users seem to be frustrated when information isn’t easily accessible or available</li>
      <li>Relationships and community are important to users for all aspects of health</li>
      <li>Users desire feedback and advice from others to gain insight about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to improve their health</li>
      <li>Users feel happy and motivated when positive reinforcements are integrated into the app</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These observations from the interviews definitely revealed to me what was important and valuable to potential users. Particularly, this phase of the design process was critical in noticing that all three participants expressed appreciation for their communities and being able to connect with others through health &amp; wellness apps or activities they had experience with in the past. Keeping this in mind, I wanted to push for some sort of community-forging element to be designed for Olive App.</p>

    <div class="container">
    <h2>Meet the Personas</h2>
    <p>2 distinct personas were created to represent real user issues as reflected from the interviews in the previous step of the design process. These personas served as a compass for the design process with their realistic needs/goals, motivations, frustrations, lifestyle, and exposure to devices &amp; interest usage. With each iteration from start to end, these personas were referenced to ensure their needs/goals and frustrations were taken into consideration for the potential user.</p>

      <h2>Wireframes &amp; Usability Testing</h2>
          <p>Mid-fidelity and fidelity wireframes were created using Adobe Illustrator and XD as I conducted 6 usability tests, there were critical errors that needed to be revised for the next iterations for the sake of accessibility. Other errors were revised as well as I sorted through negative quotes and comments brought to my attention when the participants struggled at different parts of completing the tasks and scenarios I provided to them.</p>

    <h2>Peer Reviews &amp; Further Iterations</h2>
    <p>With the next iterations, I transitioned to using Figma for the sake of being able to preview the screens I was designing at a faster speed. I received feedback from 6 fellow peer design collaborators and incorporated their comments and suggestions for the next prototype and also implemented changes based on the style guide for Olive App. The design was polished with as there were parts and pieces that could have been more accessible for one reason or another, such as bigger font size, universal icons, or even color change of text and images. Every little thing makes a difference!</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>From the start to finish of this project, I have felt a wide range of emotions from excitement, to nervousness, anxiety, and even hopefulness as I got to take part in creating something new with the involvement of my mentors, design collaborators, and people from my own life. These feelings came in waves as I was pleasantly surprised by how much knowledge and understanding I gained through each phase. Though it felt like a long haul to get here, it has definitely been rewarding being able to see how far the project has come. As I keep the human experience at the forefront, this truly motivates me to keep pushing to be a better designer!​​​​​​​<br>
